<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>For the cake</h4>
<ul>
    <li>200g cold unsalted butter (diced), plus extra
        for greasing</li>
    <li>2 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
    <li>200g dark chocolate (approx 70%), roughly chopped</li>
    <li>300g light brown muscovado sugar</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>175g self-raising flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
</ul>
<h4>For the peanut butter icing</h4>
<ul>
    <li>250g unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
    <li>600g icing sugar</li>
    <li>300g smooth peanut butter</li>
    <li>100ml double cream</li>
    <li>75g salted pretzels</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Pre heat the over to 180c/160c fan/gas 4 and 
        grease 2 x 22cm round cake tins, lining the bases 
        with baking parchment and greasing the parchment 
        too. </li>
    <li>Put the cocoa in a small bowl with 100ml hot 
        water. Whisk together until smooth, then set aside.
         Put the butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl 
         set over a pan of simmering water and melt gently 
         together, stirring occasionally. Remove from the 
         heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, beat the sugar and eggs together 
        using an electric whisk until thick and pale. With
         the blades still running, pour in the chocolate 
         mixture, mixing until smooth and fully combined. 
         In a separate bowl, mix together the flour and 
         baking powder. Sieve the dry ingredients over the 
         chocolate mixture and fold together until no lumps
         remain. Add the cocoa mixture and mix to combine.
           divide the batter between your prepared tins and
            bake for 30-35 mins or until a skewer inserted 
            into the middle comesout clean. Allow the cakes
        to cool in the tins for about 10 mins, then turn 
        out onto a wire rack, peeling off the parchment, 
        to cool completely.</li>
    <li>For the icing, beat the butter in a large bowl 
        with an electric whisk until light and creamy. 
        Beat in the icing sugar a little at a time, then 
        add the peanut butter, mixing until smooth. Add a 
        pinch of salt and the cream, again mixing until 
        smooth.</li>
    <li>To assemble the cake, use a large serrated knife 
        to slice each cake in half. Place the first round 
        of cake onto a cake board or serving plate and top
         with a thin layer of icing. Repeat until all the
          cake layers have been used. To decorate, use the 
          remaining icing to spread over the top and sides 
          of the cake. Use a spatula or a palette knife to 
          create a swirl pattern around the outside of the 
          cake, and finish by pressing the pretzels onto 
          the top and sides â€“ there is enough to cover 
          about half the sides, leaving the icing partially
           on display. Best served within 2 days of baking, 
           but the cake will keep for up to 4 days.</li>
